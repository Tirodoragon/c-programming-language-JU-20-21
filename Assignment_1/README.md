# Assignment 1
Print the values of the numbers π and $π^2$ with an accuracy of 6, 12, and 18 decimal places.

The number π can be obtained using M_PI or acos(-1) - requiring #include <math.h>.

Explicitly writing the value of π is not allowed.

For 5.0:
* Do this using a for loop for the accuracy from 4 to 18 by 2, using the format "%.*lf\n".
* Also write the program in C++ version.
